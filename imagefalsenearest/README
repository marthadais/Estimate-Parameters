README for ImageFalseNearest

	How install package:
		sudo R CMD build ImageFalseNearest
		sudo R CMD INSTALL ImageFalseNearest_0.1-01.tar.gz

-----------------------------------------------------------------------		
Apply the modified False Nearest Neighbors for all possible embedding mask sizes to estimate the most adequate parameters:
	
	Usage: image.false.nearest(image.matrix, mask.nrows, mask.ncols, end.T, rt, nn, plot.opt)

	image.matrix  = image to be evaluated
	mask.nrows    = maximum number of rows to evaluate the embedding dimension
        mask.ncols    = maximum number of colunms to evaluate the embedding dimension
	end.T	      = time lag between neighbors (default = 1)
	rt	      = radius for the neighborhood (default = 10)
	nn	      = number of nearby neighbors to be considered (default = 1)
	plot.opt      = option to plot the results (default = TRUE) 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------		
Apply the modified False Nearest Neighbors for all possible codomain obtained from linear transformation of CNN
	
	Usage: assess.number.of.kernels(image.matrix, mask.nrows, mask.ncols, end.T, nkernels, rt, nn, plot.opt)

	image.matrix  = image to be evaluated
	mask.nrows    = fixed number of rows to compute the embedding
        mask.ncols    = fixed number of colunms to compute the embedding
	end.T	      = time lag between neighbors (default = 1)
	nkernels      = possible numbers of convolutional units to be evaluated (default = 1:5)
	rt	      = radius for the neighborhood (default = 10)
	nn	      = number of nearby neighbors to be considered (default = 1)
	plot.opt      = option to plot the results (default = TRUE)
